Using LeetCode for Cracking Coding Interviews Effectively - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q15JgVVLXQg , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yf_68nHyjZc .

TIPS : https://anthonydmays.com/blog/2022/05/09/how-to-practice-leetcode-problems-the-right-way/


## 5 Mistakes:
1. The details aren't always there (ask questions in an Interview)
2. Working Code ISN'T everything (improve your efficiency)
3. Your code isn't evaluated, YOU ARE! (think out loud)
4. Focusing on things that don't matter (don't worry about comparative statistics on Leetcode)
5. Not practicing in the right setting (practice without autocomplete/syntax highlighting using a whiteboard/pen-paper)
**Aspects like how you communicate, listen and respond to things matter as much as your coding skills**

## STEPS:
1. Spend max 30 , 45, 1 hr acc to easy medium hard
2. Proper pseudocode and Time complexity in notebook
3. code first in notepad
4. comments in code , notes in notion
5. Compare solution from gfg and improve that time , Best solution -> Most votes in Discuss section.
6. Time complexity how do of built in?? How implement built in? use it?(MARK QU AS BUILT IN)
7. Rev ??


## Interview:
10 Do's during Coding Interview:

1. Clarify the question if not clear
2. Identify all the use cases including edge use cases (very important)
3. Start with Brute force ( no need to code)
4. Tell the time complexity of Brute force and move forward to find efficient approach
5. Think out loud while finding the approach (Very Imp). Ask for help no issues with that.
6. Discuss the Time and Space complexity.
7. While Coding, follow proper naming conventions for methods and variables.
8. Avoid taking variable name as i,j,k etc.
9. Always take an interviewer with you, take pause ask interviewer, are you with me?
10. Try to avoid silence during an interview and directly come up to the efficient solution.

You can learn this from other mistakes too.
So either give Mock interviews or watch others #mockinterviews , it will really gonna help you alot.
