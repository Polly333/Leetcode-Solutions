TIPS : https://anthonydmays.com/blog/2022/05/09/how-to-practice-leetcode-problems-the-right-way/

## 5 Mistakes:
1. The details aren't always there (ask questions in an Interview)
2. Working Code ISN'T everything (improve your efficiency)
3. Your code isn't evaluated, YOU ARE! (think out loud)
4. Focusing on things that don't matter (don't worry about comparative statistics on Leetcode)
5. Not practicing in the right setting (practice without autocomplete/syntax highlighting using a whiteboard/pen-paper)
**Aspects like how you communicate, listen and respond to things matter as much as your coding skills**

## STEPS:
1. Spend max 30 , 45, 1 hr acc to easy medium hard
2. Proper pseudocode and Time complexity in notebook
3. code first in notepad
4. comments in code , notes in notion
5. Compare solution from gfg and improve that time
6. Time complexity how do of built in?? How implement built in? use it?(MARK QU AS BUILT IN)
7. Rev ??
