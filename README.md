# Leetcode-Solutions
Solutions of Leetcode problems using JAVA

Using LeetCode for Cracking Coding Interviews Effectively - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q15JgVVLXQg

5 Mistakes:
1. The details aren't always there (ask questions in an Interview)
2. Working Code ISN'T everything (improve your efficiency)
3. Your code isn't evaluated, YOU ARE! (think out loud)
4. Focusing on things that don't matter (don't worry about comparative statistics on Leetcode)
5. Not practicing in the right setting (practice without autocomplete/syntax highlighting using a whiteboard/pen-paper)

Aspects like how you communicate, listen and respond to things matter as much as your coding skills
